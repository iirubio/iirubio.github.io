In light of current American events, I decided to read this book that I had in my backlog for a long time. It is a book as good as any to start writing reviews.

It presents a pretty detailed description of a fictional world in which the Axis Powers won WWII. It shows how they divided the world, did a genocide against all Africa and even changed what people believed and how they thought. From the point of view of multiple characters, none of them are particularly enthralling.
